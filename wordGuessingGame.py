# Objective: In this game, there is a list of words present, out of which our interpreter will choose 1 random word. 
# The user first has to input their names and then, will be asked to guess any alphabet. 
# If the random word contains that alphabet, it will be shown as the output(with correct placement) else the program will ask you to guess another alphabet. 
# The user will be given 12 turns(which can be changed accordingly) to guess the complete word.
